# Portfolio 7: Analyzing Koala Physical Characteristics Across Different Regions

This repository contains my work for the Portfolio 6 assignment, where I analyze koala physical characteristics across different regions. The goal of the assignment is to explore the dataset, clean it, and identify patterns and insights about koala physical attributes to aid in conservation efforts and research.

## Assignment Details

### Analyzing Koala Physical Characteristics

The objective of this analysis is to identify trends and relationships in the physical characteristics of koalas across different regions in Australia, providing useful insights for conservationists and researchers.

#### Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following fields:
- **koala_id**: Unique identifier for each koala.
- **age_in_years**: The age of the koala.
- **foot_length**: Length of the koala's foot in centimeters.
- **skull_width**: Width of the koala's skull in centimeters.
- **belly_circumference**: The belly circumference of the koala in centimeters.
- **habitat**: Habitat region where the koala was observed.
- **gender**: The gender of the koala.

### Tasks and Solutions

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
**Task:** Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Actions:**
  - Converted data types, handled missing values, and addressed outliers.
  - Corrected any misspelled values and applied one-hot encoding for categorical columns.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Task:** Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- **Actions:**
  - Descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
  - Visualized the distribution of physical characteristics by habitat and gender.

#### Identify Trends and Patterns
**Task:** Identify patterns in physical characteristics across different regions and demographics.
- **Actions:**
  - Analyzed the relationship between koala age, size, and habitat.
  - Explored differences in physical characteristics between male and female koalas.

#### Visualize Findings
**Task:** Use visualizations to represent insights from the analysis.
- **Actions:**
  - Created scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to visualize key trends and outliers.
